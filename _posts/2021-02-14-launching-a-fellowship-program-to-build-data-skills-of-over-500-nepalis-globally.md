We are excited to launch [Data Fellowship](https://codefornepal.org/data-fellowship/) to build the data skills of over 500 Nepalis. There are only two criteria to apply for this fellowship. First, applicants must be able to commit at least 5-10 hours per week for the first 2-3 months. Second, they should be curious and interested in learning new skills.

Applicants can be based anywhere. They can come from any background. They can be students, professionals, or unemployed. We highly encourage women and especially people from provinces 2 and 6 to apply.

In a world where everything is digitized, data skills have become critical. The ability to find, analyze and use data can not only help one do well professionally but also lead a more meaningful life. During this historic and tragic pandemic, we have been seen how people and businesses that are digitally connected and data-savvy can withstand the crisis compared to those who are not.

Any Nepali who is keen on making progress personally, professionally, or tackling a challenge in their community will benefit from this fellowship.

This fellowship provides a safe and convenient opportunity for Nepalis to gain new skills. Those who have access to the Internet and a laptop can take courses at their own convenience and earn certificates. The Fellows will also have the opportunity to virtually contribute to civic technology and open data products such as:

1. [Open Data Nepal](https://opendatanepal.com/)
1. [NepalMap](https://nepalmap.org/)
1. [AskNepal](https://asknepal.info/)
1. [Sangraha](http://sangraha.org/)

The total monetary value of the program is over USD 200,000 or 2 crore Nepali rupees. This fellowship would not have been possible without the generous support of [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com), a leader in building the data skills of people around the world. 

Open Knowledge Nepal and Code for Nepal have partnered to offer support for career opportunities and mentorship to Fellows.

Selected Fellows can choose to take classes from DataCamp experts at their own convenience to become Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, or Quantitative Analysts. If a Fellow has completed a certain career track and is interested in learning more skills from DataCamp, we would be keen to support that as well.

We welcome you to apply and help us spread the word.
