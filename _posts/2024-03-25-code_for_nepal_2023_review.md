[Code for Nepal](https://codefornepal.org/) continues its mission to enhance digital literacy and technology access in Nepal. Our focus remains on providing training, resources, and advocating for technology education and accessibility. Moreover, we aim to leverage technology to address societal issues and improve the lives of Nepali citizens.

In 2020, we initiated the Code for Nepal Data Fellowship, which has become one of our flagship programs. Through our partnership with [DataCamp Donates](https://www.datacamp.com/donates) , fellows gain access to a robust learning platform offering interactive courses in data science, analytics, and programming. Alongside, they join a supportive community, collaborate with peers, and receive guidance from experienced mentors. This program offers a unique opportunity for individuals to develop skills and contribute to Nepal's tech landscape and beyond.

**This article summarizes our success with DataCamp Donates for the year 2023.**

## In Person Meetups

The Code for Nepal fellows meetup in 2023 was a huge success. It wasn't an average gathering - it was a lively event where fellows got to have insightful discussions with accomplished young data professionals like Suranjan Rana Magar, Prakash Dhakal, Labbi Karmacharya, Subritt Burlakoti, and Sunny Shah. These talks weren't just about saying hello; they were opportunities for fellows to dig deep into data science, analysis, and engineering. Each conversation allowed them to ask important questions, share ideas, and gain valuable insights for their future work. They discussed DataCamp, job opportunities, academic papers, machine learning, reality of job market etc.

Beyond just sharing knowledge, the meetup was a bustling place for networking and community building. It helped forge lasting connections and partnerships that go beyond geographical boundaries and career paths.

Special thanks to Dibyesh Giri, for sharing his inspiring journey with Oho Cake, and Roshan Ghimire, for sharing the incredible origin story of Code For Nepal.

## Virtual Event


**Code for Nepal fellows network with Nirmal Budhatholi, Senior Data Scientist, Microsoft**

Our virtual event featured Nirmal Budhathoki, a seasoned professional with diverse experience in tech, including work with the US government and as a US Army veteran. Nirmal shared valuable insights on data science toolkit and essential skills, engaging in an interactive Q&A session, providing guidance for aspiring data scientists. He shared valuable insights on the Data Science Toolkit, Top Skills for Data Science, including T-shaped and Pi-shaped skills. Our interactive Q&A session with attendees was both engaging and enlightening. **Our fellows loved him !!!**

Data Crunch 2024 was another major success for us this year. Most of the participants were previous or present Code For Nepal fellows. The team comprised a dynamic mix ranging from seasoned professionals to budding enthusiasts, with many of them being engineering, AI, and data students (We also had a team with a eighth grader). They all delivered amazing projects, showcasing the immense potential of data-driven solutions in addressing Nepal's most pressing challenges. The event saw the convergence of creativity and technology as teams delved into diverse domains such as environment, healthcare, transportation, and beyond. From dynamic dashboards, amazing statistical models, to intricate Machine Learning models, the projects presented at Data Crunch 2024 were both diverse and impactful. 

With NRs. 50,000 for the first-place winners, NRs. 30,000 for the second-place team, and NRs. 20,000 for the third-place recipients, Data Crunch 2024 provided not only recognition but also tangible support for further development and refinement of the ideas presented. We had a budget of NRs. 100,000 for this hackathon, and we are proud to have spent all of it as cash prizes. A very special shoutout to Cloudfactory, for providing us the venue and delicious meal to our participants.
