Everyone who is reading my blog, hello and Namaste. Hello, my name is [Krishna Kumar Shrestha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishna-kumar-shrestha-20a35b172/), and I am now studying for a bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science at Tribhuvan University. I was born in Banepa and currently reside in Kathmandu. My favorite subject has always been mathematics, and I've always wanted to work in disciplines linked to mathematics.

I chose to major in actuarial science, which entails a lot of statistics and mathematics. As an actuarial student, being able to interpret vast amounts of data is essential. I had been studying programming languages such as C, C++, MATLAB, and R to prepare for this. The only thing I lacked was practical data experience. I learned about a [DataCamp fellowship from Code for Nepal](https://codefornepal.org/2021/02/14/launching-a-fellowship-program-to-build-data-skills-of-over-500-nepalis-globally.html) a few months ago when browsing LinkedIn. I applied after learning of this and was fortunate enough to be chosen. After receiving the scholarship from Code for Nepal, I began working on projects to gain hands-on experience. But I had the impression that I lacked the necessary talents to execute them. So, from DataCamp, I chose a professional path as a Data Analyst utilizing R.

For the past three months, DataCamp has been my best buddy and I am thoroughly enjoying the companionship it provides. I am grateful to Code for Nepal for allowing me to participate in this fellowship. DataCamp required a lot of hands-on coding, which I didn't love at first. At times, I was concerned and wondered aloud, "Will I be able to stay motivated to finish this course?" 

But, as time went on, I found that practice questions had assisted me in learning more. Those inquiries compelled me to delve further into the intricacies, hunt for more information and groomed me along the way. You know, I used to earn very little XP because I couldn't solve many questions at first, but I progressively tried, started solving problems on my own, and performed well.

The crucial thing I learned from this data fellowship is professionalism in data analysis. It has changed my vision to explore the data and I was able to generate innovative ideas from data. When I used to do my project in college, most of the time I got clean data for my analysis. But in the real world, the situation is completely different. Most of the time we will get unstructured and dirty data and we must spend too much time cleaning them. This means whatever we learned, cannot be applied until we clean them. So, what I found out is that the data camp has designed its track to fulfill these gaps and provide students with real-world skills.

I'm having so much fun at [DataCamp](http://www.datacamp.com), I've decided to pursue a career as a Data Scientist using R because [Code for Nepal](https://codefornepal.org) has motivated me to make the most of this opportunity. In a similar vein, I'm nearing the end of my certification process. Hopefully, I will complete the task and acquire DataCamp certification.

Finally, I'd like to thank the Code for Nepal team for giving me this opportunity and for arranging so many inspiring events for youth like me to learn more.
