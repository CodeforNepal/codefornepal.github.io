    <h1 class="title">How DataCamp and Code for Nepal helped me learn data engineering for free</h1>
    <p>06 Apr 2022 - Mala Deep Upadhaya</p>
    <p>
      <p><strong>Mala Deep is a Business Intelligence Consultant, and a lifelong learner. He likes to blog and share his love for data.</strong></p>

<p>If you are considering a career in the field of data, or if you have limited experience and want to learn more about it, this blog is for you. Continue reading!</p>

<p><strong>What inspired you to join the Data Fellowship?</strong></p>

<p>I have a lot of practical data science experience and frequently do data visualization and information design work. I had a gut feeling that I needed to push myself and explore more of the topics in the data domain. 
Data engineers are on the front lines of data strategy so that others don’t need to be. They are the first to deal with the inflow of structured and unstructured data into a business’s systems. Any data strategy would be incomplete without them.</p>

<p>On my LinkedIn network, I have seen people talking about data engineering and how it shaped all projects in data science. Finally, I decided I should explore being a data engineer.
Then, as with anything else in this digital era, I searched for an online program where I could learn data engineering, and because I’m from Nepal, one of the criteria we use when looking for something is that it must be available for free.
As a result, I was looking for a free data engineering course. Coursera, edx, udemy, and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">DataCamp</a>  are all places where I frequently engage. While investigating, I came across a few data engineering bootcamps in the United States. They meet the first but not the second of my criteria: they should be free.</p>

<p>And then, after a few weeks, one day I came upon a Code for Nepal post on LinkedIn. I wasn’t a stranger to Code for Nepal. Back in the day, I did some volunteer work. 
My heart leapt with delight and the thirst to learn as soon as I noticed the data fellowship post partnering with data camp.</p>

<p>I applied for the fellowship with high hopes, and I was accepted.</p>

<p><img src="https://c.tenor.com/hDZ1GpsJnDsAAAAM/amazing-dwight.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally, I began my three-month data fellowship with Code For Nepal and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">DataCamp</a> after completing my orientation. I chose the data engineering career path and began my journey.</p>

<p><strong>How difficult was the fellowship journey?</strong></p>

<p>It was totally tough. It was filled with deadlines and completing the course was not easy. During the first 4–6 weeks, I studied 49 hours a week. But after 3 weeks, the learning process was impeded due to family responsibilities. At that time, I had two options: I could drop out and offer my spot to other students looking for similar opportunities, or I could stay and push myself without any excuses. Guess what? I chose to push myself and manage my time, and lastly, you are reading this blog post.</p>

<p><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b95e9bfb83db0d66dd71de5e54918695/tumblr_pq6xg1LsCN1qisc9uo2_r1_500.gifv" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>What lessons did you learn from The Fellowship?</strong></p>

<p>I discovered that everyone, no matter how confident or successful they appear, suffers from self-doubt and imposter syndrome. What matters is that you feel the fear and go ahead and do it anyhow. Simply adopt a learning attitude and keep an eye out for opportunities. When they present themselves, seize the opportunity without further delay. Also, I learned that individuals are willing to assist if I know how to ask and what I require.</p>

<p><strong>Would you suggest Data Fellowship to a friend?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, absolutely!  Beyond all the amazing resources, sessions, and opportunities, The Fellowship is an experience that will make a difference in many aspects of your life. It did in my life and will shape lots of areas. For those that are currently feeling unfulfilled in their career and are not sure what their next move is, The Fellowship will help you identify your skills, values, and what’s important to you in your career and will help you push beyond your comfort zone by equipping you with the skills. Data engineering, data science, data analysis, machine learning and much more. All you have to do is decide and be disciplined about the decision.</p>

<p><strong>Any words to future fellowship seekers?</strong></p>

<p>Lookout for the next cohort and apply without hesitation. As Code for Nepal is offering free access to DataCamp, all you need is time and a desire to learn.Remember, Albert Einstein once said,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The only source of knowledge is experience.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was right, but it does not have to be your experience. 
You can leverage knowledge from other people’s lessons. You can stand on the shoulders of giants. Like Stand on the shoulders of <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">DataCamp</a> and Code for Nepal and pave your career the way you intended.</p>

<p><strong>What are you doing right now?</strong></p>

<p>At the moment, I’m working on a data engineering project and writing some blogs. If you enjoy reading, please have a look at my few blogs on <a href="https://medium.com/@maladeep.upadhaya">Medium</a> and let me know what you think. (Oh, did I mention that if you haven’t developed a love of reading, you should check out my blog; who knows, it might pique your interest.)</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to express my gratitude to Code for Nepal for providing a fantastic opportunity to the Nepali community, as well as <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">DataCamp</a> for believing in Code for Nepal.</p>
