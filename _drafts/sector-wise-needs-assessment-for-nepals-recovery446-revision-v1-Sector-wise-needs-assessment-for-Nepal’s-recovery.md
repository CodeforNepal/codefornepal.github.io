The [sectoral breakdown](http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/SAR/nepal/Nepal-PDNA-Damage-by-sector-June-2015.pdf) of the needs assessment data provided by the Nepal government shows that housing and reconstruction will need the biggest support. It is crucial that these needs are met fairly among those affected.

Since this sector will take the biggest chunk of recovery budget, the recovery process should look at the most cost-effective, earthquake resistant and income generating solutions.

Strategies such as assessing the pre-disaster level of income of those affected and divvying up the reconstruction support are important in order to tackle disaster-induced poverty.

Education, tourism, finance and commerce and industry are the other sectors with highest needs after housing and human settlements. Governance needs are at 16,664 million NPR.

Since the rebuilding will need a bigger involvement of the government in allocating and monitoring the process, a detailed breakdown of this amount will help understand how the governance sector needs have been assessed and whether they are justified.
