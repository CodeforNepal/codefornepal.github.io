<span style="font-weight: 400;">Children are considered to be the foundation that the future of a nation rests upon.  Only a proper investment in today’s children will bring us a better tomorrow. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But a quick glance at child nourishment data on <a href="https://nepalmap.org">www.nepalmap.org</a> shows that </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">40 %</span>](http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/country-NP-nepal/#child-health) <span style="font-weight: 400;">children under the age of five in Nepal are malnourished. Under such scenario, almost half of the children in Nepal do not get a well-balanced meal, which is bound to hamper nation’s development.</span>

The six districts namely Humla, Bajhang, Baitadi, Surkhet, Doti, Achham, Okhaldhunga, Terhathum, Panchthar have a staggeringly high percentage of child malnourishment rate, all above 56 percent, with Humla being the district with the highest number of <span style="font-weight: 400;">children malnourished. Only 4 out of 10 children in Humla get proper nourishment which is an alarming statistics.</span>

**Here are six districts with the highest rate of malnourished children under age five in Nepal**

To find out malnourishment rates for children under age five in your districts, check out this **[<span style="color: #ff0000;">interactive map</span>](http://www.nepalmap.org/data/map/?table=CHILD_NOURISHMENT&geo_ids=district|country-NP,vdc|district-21,district|country-NP,district|country-NP&primary_geo_id=district-21#column%7Cpercent%20malnourished%2Csumlev%7Cdistrict). **

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Possible reasons for such distribution could be poverty, lack of fertile land for cultivation: geography, climate being possible causes, unavailability of roads and other means of transport, lack of proper awareness and education, diseases accompanied during childbirth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">   To reduce the number of malnourished children, here are a few suggestions:</span>

  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reliable transportation facility throughout the nation for the distribution of local, nutritious products in cheaper rates.</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Education and dissemination of information on nutrition. The government should also train local farmers on efficient agricultural practices such as crop rotation.</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Allocation of funding to child nutrition programs.</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Expand reach through community health workers</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Research and development to increase crop yields.</span>
