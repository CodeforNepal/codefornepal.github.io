Code for Nepal is made by volunteers. We believe everyone can contribute. If you would like to join Code for Nepal, [contact us](https://codefornepal.org/en/help/). Read about Pratima Kandel, a member of Code for Nepal.

**_Who are you and tell us how/where did you grow up?  
_**  
I am Cliff McIntosh. I grew up in west Texas in the U.S. These days, I live in Chicago and work as a software developer.

**_How did you become involved with Code for Nepal?  
_**  
I have had an interest in Nepal from the time that I was a Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in Dadeldhura district. I was looking for a volunteer opportunity and answered a call for volunteers on the Code for Nepal website. Ravi Nepal asked if I would be interested in helping launch a tool that makes census and other data available. That’s how I became involved with Code for Nepal and our NepalMap project.

**_Code for Nepal is a volunteer-run organization, many of the volunteers have daytime jobs outside of Code for Nepal. Therefore, where is your passion and dedication for this organization derived from?  
_**  
I want to be able to use my software development skills for social good. Working with Code for Nepal on the NepalMap project allows me to do that.

****_What is your role in Code for Nepal? Do you see yourself changing this role anytime in the future?_****I am a developer on the NepalMap project. Amit Chaudhary and I worked closely with other Code for Nepal team members and volunteers to launch the first version of the project. I am the team member who serves as the primary resource for working with the Wazimap framework that we use for NepalMap. I hope to continue to serve as a developer with NepalMap, but I would also like to have the opportunity to mentor other developers so that responsibility and skills can be shared.

**_How is Code for Nepal different or special from other non-profits?  
_** **_  
_** Code for Nepal is different because it allows us to get involved by using our technical skills to serve a social good.
