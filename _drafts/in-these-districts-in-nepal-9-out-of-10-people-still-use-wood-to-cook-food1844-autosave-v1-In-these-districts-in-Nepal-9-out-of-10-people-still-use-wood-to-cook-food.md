<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firewood has been a traditional source of fuel to cook in Nepal. Though few districts now use LPG gas and electricity, let’s take a look at what the data reveals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the data from </span>[nepalmap.org](http://www.nepalmap.org), [<span style="font-weight: 400;">64%</span>](http://nepalmap.org/profiles/country-NP-nepal/#households-cooking-fuel) <span style="font-weight: 400;">people in Nepal are still dependent upon wood to cook their food. That means out 6 out of every 10 Nepali still uses wood to cook their food.</span>

With forests being destroyed for fuel, there is a need for alternative sources of energy for fuel.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some alternatives could be a solar based cooker, bio-briquettes, biogas and so on. Many households have already harnessed benefits from such options and usage has been increasing steadily in various parts of Nepal.</span>

Based on solar potential, many districts use solar based lightening however only a few districts use solar based cooking methods.
