<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, every family is unique but thanks to the Annual Household Survey published by the Nepal Government, we know how an average Nepali family spends its money. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The average annual household consumption in 2015/16 was Rs, 3,22,730 or approximately USD 3,111.12. (Exchange rate: 1 Nepalese Rupee equals 0.0096 US Dollar)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More than half of household consumption (53.8%) went toward food, while 12.9% was spent on rent, 4% on education, and 3.9% on alcohol and tobacco. </span>
