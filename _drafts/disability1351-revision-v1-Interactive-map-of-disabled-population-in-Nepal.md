In 2011, two percent (1.94%; 513,321) of the total population of Nepal reported having &#8220;some kind of disability,&#8221; according to the Nepal Census.

**Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the different types of disabilities: **

  * Physical disability: 36.3 percent of the disabled population
  * Blindness/Low vision: 18.5 percent
  * Deaf/Hard of hearing: 15.4 percent
  * Speech problem: 11.5 percent
  * Multiple disabilities: 7.5 percent
  * Mental disability: 6 percent
  * Intellectual disability: 2.9 percent
  * Deaf-Blind: 1.8%

**Here are the five districts with the highest of number of physically disabled people, based on the 2011 Census:**

  1. Kathmandu 6,030
  2. Morang 6,029
  3. Kailali 5,631
  4. Jhapa 5,524
  5. Surkhet 4,627

**It&#8217;s estimated that after the [earthquakes in 2015](https://codefornepal.org/en/2015/04/map-of-reported-nepalearthquake-deaths/), the number of disabled persons in Nepal has likely increased.** Because of the earthquakes, [thousands of Nepalis](http://nepal.iom.int/jupgrade/index.php/en/earthquake-response/20-cat-latest-news/186-restoring-dignity-to-disabled-people-in-post-quake-nepal) were &#8220;temporarily or permanently disabled through crush or other injuries.&#8221;

Nepal has historically lacked the capacity to assist the disabled population either by creating accessible infrastructure or providing support in other ways. After the earthquake, the National Federation of the Disabled, Nepal (NFDN), released an [urgent appeal](http://www.nfdn.org.np/appeal) to advocate for the &#8220;inclusion of persons with disabilities in Disaster Response Programs.&#8221;

To increase awareness of the challenges faced by disabled persons in Nepal and to promote inclusive tourism, [International Development Institute (IDI)](https://www.facebook.com/internationaldevelopmentinstitute/?fref=ts), is organizing an [accessible tourism program](https://www.facebook.com/events/246902759024817/) in Nepal, in collaboration with [Soarway Foundation](https://www.soarway.org/), and others.
