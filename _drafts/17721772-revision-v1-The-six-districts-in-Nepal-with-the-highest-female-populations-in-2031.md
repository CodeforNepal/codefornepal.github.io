According to [<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NepalMap</strong></span>](https://nepalmap.org/), a data reporting tool by Code for Nepal, six districts to have the highest projected female concentration in Nepal 2031 are:

[<span style="color: #ff0000;">Manang</span>](http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/district-39-manang/)  
[<span style="color: #ff0000;">Parsa</span>](http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/district-33-parsa/)  
[ <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mugu</span>](http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/district-53-mugu/)  
[ <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bhaktapur</span>](http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/district-25-bhaktapur/)  
[ <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lalitpur</span>](http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/district-26-lalitpur/)  
 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kathmandu</span>

Districts such as Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kathmandu are known for high literacy rate  
and gender equality, which could make them favorable living options for women.

On the other hand, male counterparts in districts such as Manang, Parsa, and Mugu are known to travel gulf countries and India as migrant workers, which could explain for more female concentration left in such districts.
