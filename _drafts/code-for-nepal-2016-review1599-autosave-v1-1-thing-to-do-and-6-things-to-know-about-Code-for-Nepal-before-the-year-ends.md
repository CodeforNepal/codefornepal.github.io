    <b>Using photos and videos to help build inclusive Nepal:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In a bid to raise awareness on digital literacy and generate culture-driven creative content, we launched the “Ko Nepali?” </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/codefornepal/videos/?ref=page_internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/codefornepal/photos/?tab=album&album_id=504212909787962"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Photo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Competition in February.

In February, we released results from the survey we conducted in Barpark, Gorkha, the epicenter of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit the country on April 25th, 2015. 98% of the respondents (out of sample population of 703) said they had received relief aid within 1-8 weeks of the earthquake. However, after ten months of the incident, most of the locals were still living in temporary shelters, even in the prevailing sub-zero temperatures. We shared the data with a local non-profit working to help the people of Barpark so their efforts can be directed by the voice of the local residents and their needs.</span>
