  about_program: "
Assemble a dynamic team of 3-6 members to pioneer the transformation of Nepal's future through data exploration in diverse domains such as environment, healthcare, transportation, and more. Immerse yourselves in the wealth of non-proprietary data, crafting open-sourced and meticulously documented projects that range from dynamic prototypes to actionable solutions, all housed in Code For Nepal's repository.

During the hackathon, the emphasis is not on execution but on the creation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Present a compelling argument showcasing your understanding of the problem, innovative approach, proposed solution, and potential impact. Following the event, you stand a chance to be awarded cash incentives, providing you with the means to advance and refine your ideas beyond the hackathon. This is an opportunity to not only ideate but to embark on a journey of continued development and real-world impact. Your vision for a data-driven Nepal begins here.
