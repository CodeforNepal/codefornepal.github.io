    <p>10 May 2021 - Nigin Pun</p>
    <p>
      <p><img src="https://codefornepal.org/data-fellowship/assets/og-image.jpeg" alt="Launching a Fellowship program to build data skills of over 500 Nepalis globally" /></p>

<p>If you ask me if my gap year has taught me anything significant, I’d say that seeking knowledge continuously is the one thing that has stayed with me.</p>

<p>And Code for Nepal came at the right time to act as a bridge when I was searching for ways to learn data science for free! How?</p>

<p>Code for Nepal launched its fellowship program where fellows would get access to <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/donates">DataCamp</a> for $0!</p>

<p>I felt like I hit the jackpot and I didn’t think twice before applying because I knew it was the right fit for me. DataCamp as part of its <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/datacamp-donates-50-partners">global effort</a> to build data skills donated thousands of subscriptions to organizations and schools globally.</p>

<p>As a fellow at Code for Nepal, I got access to a multitude of courses and resources via <a href="https://codefornepal.org/2021/02/14/launching-a-fellowship-program-to-build-data-skills-of-over-500-nepalis-globally">Data Fellowship</a> which let me dive deep into the data world like never before.</p>

<p>It was euphoric to re-learn courses interactively which I had learned via different online courses that were like traditional classes but on a computer!</p>

<p>But with DataCamp, I could code simultaneously while getting instructions. Subsequently, my learning time grew exponentially!</p>

<p>I had the time of my life exploring Business Analytics courses during my gap year.</p>

<p>Frustrated, I started recording my eating habits on an excel sheet and visualized it to find patterns between my diet and its influence on my sinus problem.</p>

<p>Finding that dairy products and low water consumption was related to surged congestion and toothache, I changed my diet and increased water consumption to improve my health.</p>

<p>I also increased my yoga time after noticing a pattern between reduced toothache and increased yoga duration.</p>

<p>Subsequently, my interest in Analytics grew even more. I plan to utilize the robust analytics program at DataCamp to shape solutions to people’s problems like I did for myself.</p>

<p>DataCamp has courses that have helped me leverage data tools, maintaining databases, and creating and managing data analytics that helps me connect dots between marketing and analytics, improving my problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>Using the tools, I was able to identify students’ major issues (analysis) and address them in collaboration with our startup- TheVidhwan’s- student ambassadors by acquiring and analyzing 300 student data.</p>

<p>During college, I aspire to continue connecting the dots between marketing and analytics thereby improving my problem-solving skills. Through analysis and models, I want to create patterns and unravel mysteries about people’s behavior to have a deeper understanding of their problems.</p>

<p>And through marketing, I plan to shape creative ideas to connect and communicate with people.</p>

<p>The Data Fellowship has allowed me to indulge myself with guided and self-started projects which adds a whole new perspective to my experience as I tackle real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>And DataCamp has made it easy enough for me to execute such projects at the comfort of my home sipping coffee!</p>

<p>For my project, I collected, analyzed, and visualized company data of Pacific Human Resources Pvt. Ltd that is being used for the company’s marketing and its website.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the community that we have at Code for Nepal Fellowship is just what I needed while struggling with my project.</p>

<p>Our monthly session that is led by the founder himself allowed me to get my questions answered by him and other data professionals.</p>

<p>Capitalizing on the power of data has helped me realize how much progress we need to make as a country.</p>

<p>And for that reason, I am starting the change with myself and the people around me!</p>
