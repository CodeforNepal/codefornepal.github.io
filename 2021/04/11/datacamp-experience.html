    <h1 class="title">How DataCamp is helping me learn data science</h1>
    <p>11 Apr 2021 - Anshu Adhikari</p>
    <p>
      <p><img src="https://codefornepal.org/data-fellowship/assets/og-image.jpeg" alt="Launching a Fellowship program to build data skills of over 500 Nepalis globally" /></p>

<p>In college, I am planning to study computer science and economics. However, I did not want to wait to learn the basics of data science till I got to college. In that sense, DataCamp has truly helped me overcome the barriers of time and space.</p>

<p>I got access to <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">DataCamp</a> as a member of Code for Nepal, a non-profit organization working to increase digital literacy and data literacy in Nepal. DataCamp as part of its <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/datacamp-donates-50-partners">global effort</a> to build data skills donated thousands of subscriptions to organizations and schools globally.</p>

<p>As I worked to enhance the learning experiences of 100s of others who were selected as Code for Nepal’s <a href="https://codefornepal.org/2021/02/14/launching-a-fellowship-program-to-build-data-skills-of-over-500-nepalis-globally">Data Fellows</a>, I was increasing my own knowledge of data science and familiarity with DataCamp. The courses on datacamp are developed to meet the expectations of learners at every level including one like myself. I have realized that to ensure the quality of learning and include the needs of different types of learners, tools like podcasts, hints, assessments have been developed. I have found them very helpful.</p>

<p>Also, students can rate the courses and give feedback about their learning experience to DataCamp which helps improve the courses.</p>

<p>I had no prior experience with programming languages. I knew a little bit of HTML and Q-basic that I had learned in middle school. As a total beginner at the start of my datacamp journey, I discovered ‘Introduction to python’, “Introduction to R”, and “Introduction to SQL, are free courses on DataCamp and they were the perfect place to start. After I finished these free courses I took a skilled assessment which recommended me to learn Python.</p>

<p>The next step in my journey was to start my first lesson on DataCamp. This is where I had to decide to make a decision of whether I wanted to start with an individual course or a track. The courses started with very basic: types, variables, basic calculations. Therefore even as a beginner that has never written or read a single line of code, I was able to follow the material presented very easily.</p>

<p>The courses on DataCamp take place on your browser so you don’t have to download anything to learn. I am very impressed with the concept of interactive e-learning with DataCamp as it allowed me to become active with my own learning experience. Interestingly DataCamp XP is a symbolic point-system that rewards learners like me for engaging in learning. XP is awarded to learners for progressing in courses, exercises, and projects.</p>

<p>When I use hints or show answer methods for solving problems a certain amount of my XP was used which motivated me to try and solve problems on my own as I did not want to lose the hard-earned XP.</p>

<p>DataCamp also has a section dedicated to getting real-life experience with projects. I have some courses bookmarked so that I know what I have next on my list to achieve and I can revise by taking assessments that are already there on datacamp for me. On the live events tab, there are always upcoming events which has webinars and live training sessions to learn about data-driven organizations. I am thrilled to learn new things every day and datacamp feels like a roadmap where I am on a data car that leads me safely by minimizing risk and providing clarity to reach my destination as a data scientist. This journey has to be my favorite of all time.</p>

<p>Finally, let me share that when I finished my first-course introduction to python I was very proud of myself. After all, I managed to accomplish a significant step towards eventually becoming a data expert. I realized that becoming data fluent would require more time and dedication. I look forward to completing more courses, tracks, and projects that DataCamp has to offer.</p>

<p>This may be the fact that all our fellows at DataCamp have a positive experience with different courses like python, R, SQL, and Machine learning. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a high school student, I realized it is necessary to reinforce the various learning Opportunities that prioritizes strengthening my data skills and DataCamp was the best platform for it.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, I will share how others in our community are using DataCamp. In the meantime, I would be curious to hear about your experience in coding. Please share your experiences or thoughts in the comment section below.</p>
